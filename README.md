# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application that allows users to check if a word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is the same backward as forward.

## How to use

1. Enter a word in the text box.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. The result will be displayed below the button.

## Example

If you enter the word "madam", the result will be "madam is a palindrome".

## How it works

The application uses a JavaScript function to check if a word is a palindrome. The function first converts the word to lowercase. Then, it compares the word to its reverse. If the word is the same as its reverse, then the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
